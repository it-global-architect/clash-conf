<h1> Clash Groups creator </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is just a config that creates nice groups based on https://github.com/ACL4SSR/ACL4SSR <BR>
I'm not the owner neither creator of this tool. I just used it to create some nice groups.<br>
If you want more customizations you also can create it by yourself or help me improove this one here.<br>
  
  
  <h2> INSTALL STEPS </h2>
  
  * Convert your subscription to a groups subscription using this page: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/it-global-architect/clash-conf/blob/main/clash-groups-creator.html
  
  * Add the new generated subscription to your clash.
  
  * To see the groups open YACD from you clash panel. I suggest you to bookmark YACD address so you don't need to open clash anymore.
  
  
  
  <h2> GROUPS DESCRIPTION</h2>
  
		<h3>Main Group:</h3>
  All the sites and services that does not fit another group.<br>
  Suggestion to use All Auto to get the fastest server around
  
	<h3>Streaming groups (Disney, Netflix, HBO,...):</h3>
  Choose the region of your preference. 
  
	<h3>China Group:</h3>
  Chinese websites and other sites that are not blocked in China. Just set as direct connection for better performance and avoid errors.
  
  <h3>Brazil Relay:<h3>
  It uses a relay system to reach Brazil in a very fast way. This is good to unlock Disney, HBO, Netflix....
  
		<h3>Microsoft and Apple Groups:</h3>
	Both usually works better with direct connection but sometimes we need to use VPN for it.
  
  <h3>Global:</h3>
	This is default and not used for nothing as far as I know.
  
		<h3>BJ-Share Group:</h3>
	This is a private customization, just ignore it.
  
		<h3>Source IP group:</h3>
	This is a private customization, it bypass any other configuration for devices with the ip range from 192.168.3.248 to 192.168.3.254
